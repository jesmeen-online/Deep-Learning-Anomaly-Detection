# Effective deep time-series forecasting model
A deep learning-based abnormalities detection technique named DeepMaly is a predicting algorithm that is based on CNN. CNN is a
branch of Artificial Intelligence that can be applied in distinct types of applications for its parametric efficiency, particularly in NLP
(Natural Language Processing) and CV (Computer Vision). As it processes a mathematical model named convolution, it is rightly
named after that particular model. The CNN network consists of many layers such as convolution and pooling, and all the layers are
connected to each other in the network. Typically, each convolutional layer contains two phases. The layer executes the convolution
operation in the first step and gives the result of its linear activations. Afterwards, every linear activation must undergo a non-linear
activation. Convolution is a mathematical process that produces a third function by combining two functions with real-valued
parameters.
Time series datasets have unique characteristics; hence it was chosen to employ CNNs for unsupervised novelty discovery in these
datasets. Because of its intrinsic simplicity, conventional CNNs are a better fit for these datasets since they place more of a focus on
temporal dependencies than spatial patterns. When used for time series data rather than high-resolution image data, improved CNN
models usually only result in marginal performance gains for novelty recognition. For datasets with limited resources, traditional CNNs
are advantageous because they are computationally efficient and more flexible to various input dimensions. The most fundamental
benefit of traditional CNNs is that they provide a clear.
